# AI-Bartending-Table
This piece of furniture looks like a regular table, but underneath is a hidden secret. Powered by a raspberry pi, this table uses a series of pumps and servos to quickly and discretely mix cocktails with voice commands.

### Note
This project has been put on the backburner for now since it is mostly functional, but there are still some kinks to iron out before it is complete. I don't go home too much now so I have not transfered the code from the pi onto github just yet.
